  Description:
    Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

    <h1> defines the largest heading.
    <h6> defines the smallest heading.

    Headings Are Important:
    It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
    <h1> headings should be main headings, followed by <h2> headings,
    then the less important <h3> and so on.
